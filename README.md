# MERN Showcase Website

## Description

Welcome to the MERN Showcase Website, a project designed to demonstrate practical skills and knowledge in full-stack development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This website is a portfolio of sorts, showcasing not just the ability to code, but to construct a fully functional and interactive web application.

The heart of this project lies in its diverse features, each serving a specific purpose and demonstrating a unique aspect of the MERN stack's capabilities:
- **Home Page**: The starting point of the website, providing an overview of what the project entails.
- **CRUD Resume (Job Log)**: A practical demonstration of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, showcasing how user-generated data can be managed effectively.
- **Web Concepts**: A resourceful section offering insights into various web development concepts, reflecting a commitment to learning and knowledge sharing.
- **Projects Gallery**: A visual display of various projects, highlighting the diversity and scope of development skills.
- **API Integration (Staff Page)**: Demonstrates real-world application of API integration, showcasing how external data can be fetched, displayed, and interacted with.
- **Order System**: An interactive feature allowing users to simulate product orders, demonstrating handling of user inputs and dynamic data.

Through this website, I aim to present not just my technical skills, but also an understanding of how these skills can be applied to create meaningful and user-friendly web applications. The project is an ongoing journey of learning, building, and refining, and I hope it serves as a testament to my dedication and passion for web development.

## Deployment Status

### Server-Side Code on GitHub
The server-side code for this project is hosted on GitHub. This repository includes all the back-end functionalities essential for the operation of the MERN Showcase Website.

### Front-End Deployment
The live version of this website was previously deployed on Netlify, providing a real-world demonstration of the project in action. This deployment was instrumental in showcasing the project's capabilities to a wider audience and offered an interactive experience of the website's features.

### Current Deployment Status
As of now, the live deployment on Netlify has been temporarily disabled. This decision was taken due to financial constraints associated with maintaining the site live. It's important to note that this pause is a strategic move to ensure the sustainability of the project and does not detract from the quality and functionality of the code.

I are actively exploring cost-effective solutions to bring the live version back online in the future. In the meantime, the GitHub repository stands as a testament to the project's capabilities and serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding the structure and functionality of the site.
